A (hopefully usefull) set of R functions to make an igraph object. A perl script is provided which converts an adjaceny matrix into a list of edges. Using the list of edges the graph object can be made with MakeGraphObject() which should be imported to your R code as source. The function plotg() draws the resulting graph object. 

Good luck!
